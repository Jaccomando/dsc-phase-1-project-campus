# Microsoft Movie Studio Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes movie data from IMDB and Box Office Mojo to help guide Microsoft's new movie studio business as it evaluates the best way to compete with others such as Netflix, Amazon, Disney, etc. Descriptive analysis of movie data shows that certain movie genres do much better at the box office than others. Microsoft is looking for recommendations for what typ of films do the best at the box office. Microsoft can use this analysis to focus their studio on certain film genres.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired me to help them better understand the movie industry. I am charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

To do this I will answer the following questions. 

*What movie genre in the last five years in the US market has the highest user ratings? 
*What movie genre in the last five years in the US market has the highest number of reviews? 
*What movie genre in the last five years in the US market has the highest gross box office revenue?
*Do ratings and revenue correlate?

## Data

IMDB and Box Office Mojo combined have a tremendous amound of data specific to movies. Data includes information on movie ratings, votes, domestic and international box office revenue, production companies, languages, etc. For this analysis I will use data from imdb.title.basics, imdb.title.akas, imdb.title.ratings and bom.movie_gross. 

## Methods



## Results

For US films released in the last five years the highest viewer ratings were for Documentaries, Musicals, Biography and History genres. But that doesn't mean they have high numbers of ratings votes. Rather they have very low vote counts. It seems there is no relation between high ratings and number of ratings.

Sci_Fi movies receive far more votes than any other genre, with Adventure, Action, Western and Fantasy also well represented.

Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation, Action, and Fantasy genres round up the top five genres for Box Office Gross revenue in the US in the last five years. Sci-Fi and Adventure, Action and Fantasy are all in the top five genres with the highest count of Viewer Ratings. So there is some correlation between number of Viewer Ratings and Box Office revenue.

## Conclusions
This analysis answers Microsoft's business question regarding where to focus their movie making efforts. Clearly Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation, Action, and Fantasy are the genres generating the most box office revenue. It also suggests that the number of viewer ratings posted online correlates to box office revenue. So Microsoft should consider marketing campaigns geared toward generating high number of viewer reviews. And be aware that the actual rating value appears to have little to do with success at the box office.



## Next Steps
Further analyses could yield additional insights as to the relationship between the number of viewer ratings, the rating value itself and box office revenue.
Following a successful US launch we can provide additional analysis on other markets such as APAC, EMEA, Central and South America etc.
